# 404speak.js 𓂀 

> *“Every dead link is a whisper. Every error, an omen.”*

404speak.js is a lightweight JavaScript parasite that transforms ordinary 404 pages into interactive oracles. It harvests digital entropy—browser fingerprints, timestamps, and referrers—to conjure procedurally generated prophecies, creating the illusion that the website *knew you were coming.*

---

## 🩸 What It Does
- Replaces boring 404s with cryptic, personalized messages
- Styles your error pages with haunting themes
- Uses local entropy to generate a unique Seed
- Supports future expansion: remote prophecy echo network, glyph rendering, AI integration

---

## 🔧 Quick Install

Add this to any 404.html page:

```html
<script src="404speak.js" data-theme="glitchpunk"></script>
```

Optional `data-theme` values:
- `glitchpunk`
- `neodivine`
- `dreamgrave`

---

## 🧬 Entropy Structure
Each visitor generates:
- `ua`: User-Agent
- `ref`: Referrer
- `time`: Local timestamp
- `seed`: Random base36 hash fragment

This data feeds the prophecy engine. Future versions will use it to determine glyph pairings, cross-visitor resonance, and oracle convergence.

---

## 🌐 SigilNet (Coming Soon)
A distributed network of 404speak-enabled sites that whisper to each other.

When two entropy profiles resonate, the Oracle will echo:
> “Another received this same truth. Find them.”
